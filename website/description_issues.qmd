# Formatting Software Names

## Problem

The automatic spell check has flagged a software name as incorrect and results in a NOTE.

## Solution

All references to names of software, packages and API names in the description section of the DESCRIPTION file should be wrapped in single quotes. e.g.: 'ggplot2', 'python', etc.

The description section in the [DESCRIPTION file](https://github.com/tidyverse/readr/blob/main/DESCRIPTION) of the 'readr' package provides an example which uses single quotes around the package name and file extensions:

```         
Description: The goal of 'readr' is to provide a fast and friendly way to
    read rectangular data (like 'csv', 'tsv', and 'fwf').  It is designed
    to flexibly parse many types of data found in the wild, while still
    cleanly failing when data unexpectedly changes.
```

### Details

Words in single quotes are not flagged by the automatic spell check and may be used when appropriate to include references to software names **only**.
