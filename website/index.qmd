# Introduction

The CRAN Cookbook has been developed as part of a special project grant from the R Consortium in 2024. The proposal is titled: **Improving the Skills of R Package Maintainers**. The goals of the project are:

1. Educate a diverse cohort of young R developers to acquire the technical knowledge and skills required to participate in the continuous integration of R packages into the R ecosystem.
2. Develop a new documentation solution with a Quarto website that is user-friendly for new R package maintainers on CRAN.
3. Identify common CRAN submission issues and create a framework of "problems" and "solutions" that are easy to implement and discover.
